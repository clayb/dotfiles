Actually, the best shit ever.\r\n\r\n## install\r\n\r\nRun this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/mattryan/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\r\ncd ~/.dotfiles\r\nrake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nSymlinks erring thang to your $HOME dir.\r\n\r\nEdit this `zsh/zshrc.symlink`.\r\n\r\nUpdate this `git/gitconfig.symlink`.\r\n\r\n## components\r\n\r\nThere's a few special files in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\r\n  available everywhere.\r\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\r\n  environment.\r\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into\r\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\r\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\r\n  symlinked in when you run `rake install`.\r\n- **topic/\\*.completion.zsh**: Any files ending in `completion.sh` get loaded\r\n  last so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions.\r\n\r\n## thanks\r\n\r\nI forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/)'s excellent\r\n[dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and am rolling out my own\r\nconfig.","google":"UA-36384574-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
